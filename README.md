# C-OOP-Instrument-inventory
This is a C# OOP program I created to maintain and document the musical instruments I own.  
Instruments can be added to or removed through the values.csv file

---

The information that the program reads and prints about each instrument is
Companyname, Instrumentname, Instrumenttype, countrybuild, builddate
such as
Gibson - Les Paul - Electric Guitar - USA - 1961

This was a fun project that will actually be pretty helpful for me

The program has no special requirements.  Just open it and run it in Visual Studio and it should be good to go
